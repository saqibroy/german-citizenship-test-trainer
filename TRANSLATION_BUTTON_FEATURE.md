  - Release to return to original language
  - Works with both mouse (mouseDown/mouseUp) and touch (touchStart/touchEnd)
- Button changes color when active (blue background)

- Applies to both Training and Flashcards modes

**Question System**:
- SRS weight calculation with Anki-style intervals

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended):
1. **Add Priority Vocabulary** (from VOCABULARY_ADDITIONS.md)
   - Start with TIER 1 words (most essential)
   - Add example sentences from actual test questions
   - Ensure proper categorization

2. **Test Translation Buttons**
   - Test on dev server (localhost:5176)
   - Verify press-and-hold works on mobile
   - Check that option clicking still works properly

### Future Enhancements:
3. **Vocabulary Enhancement Script**
   - Create automated script to extract words from questions
   - Match with suggested vocabulary list
   - Generate example sentences automatically

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Voice pronunciation for vocabulary
   - Personal notes for each question/word
   - Progress export/import feature
   - Study reminders based on SRS intervals

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Components Modified:
- **App.tsx** (1597 lines):
  - QuizPage: Added translation button functionality
  - TrainingPage: Added translation button functionality
  - Added `hoveredOption` state management
  
### Key Functions:
- Translation toggle: Uses mouseDown/Up and touchStart/End events
- Display logic: Switches between `opt.text` and `translationArray[opt.originalIndex]`
- Prevents clicks: Button is separate from option button

### State Management:
```typescript
const [hoveredOption, setHoveredOption] = useState<number | null>(null);
```

### UI Components:
```tsx
<button
  onMouseDown={() => setHoveredOption(idx)}
  onMouseUp={() => setHoveredOption(null)}
  onMouseLeave={() => setHoveredOption(null)}
  onTouchStart={() => setHoveredOption(idx)}
  onTouchEnd={() => setHoveredOption(null)}
  className={showingTranslation ? 'bg-blue-500' : 'bg-white'}
>
  <Globe size={18} />
</button>
```

### After:
