# Vocabulary Training Improvements

## Changes Made (October 19, 2025)

### ðŸŽ² Random Vocabulary Order
- **Vocabulary now appears in random order** during training sessions
- Each training session shuffles the selected vocabulary completely
- No more predictable patterns - keeps learning fresh and engaging

### ðŸŽ¯ Tier-Based Learning Strategy
The system now implements a smart progression strategy:

#### **Phase 1: Tier 1 Focus (0-80% mastery)**
- 70% Tier 1 (Essential vocabulary)
- 20% Tier 2 (Important vocabulary)
- 10% Tier 3 (Useful vocabulary)

#### **Phase 2: Tier 2 Focus (Tier 1 at 80%+)**
- 20% Tier 1 (Review to maintain mastery)
- 60% Tier 2 (Important vocabulary)
- 20% Tier 3 (Useful vocabulary)

#### **Phase 3: Tier 3 Focus (Tier 1 & 2 at 80%+)**
- 15% Tier 1 (Review to maintain mastery)
- 25% Tier 2 (Review to maintain mastery)
- 60% Tier 3 (Useful vocabulary)

### ðŸ“Š Mastery Tracking
- **Mastery Definition**: 80%+ accuracy with at least 3 attempts
- Visual progress bars for each tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- Clear indication of current focus tier
- Real-time mastery percentages displayed

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Improvements
- **Color-coded Tier Progress Bars**:
  - Tier 1 (Essential): Red
  - Tier 2 (Important): Orange
  - Tier 3 (Useful): Yellow
- Current focus tier displayed prominently
- Mastery counts shown (e.g., "15/45" words mastered)

### ðŸ§  Smart Selection Algorithm
The vocabulary selection algorithm now:
1. **Prioritizes by tier** (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3)
2. **Tracks mastery level** for each word
3. **Adapts focus** based on overall tier mastery
4. **Randomizes final order** for unpredictable practice
5. **Maintains spacing** through SRS (Spaced Repetition System)

### ðŸ“ˆ Learning Path
Your vocabulary learning now follows a clear path:
1. **Master Tier 1** (Essential citizenship vocabulary)
2. **Master Tier 2** (Important supporting vocabulary)
3. **Master Tier 3** (Useful additional vocabulary)

Each tier must reach 80% mastery before the system shifts primary focus to the next tier, though you'll still see words from all tiers for variety and review.

## Benefits
âœ… **Random order** prevents memorization of sequence  
âœ… **Tier-based focus** ensures essential vocabulary is learned first  
âœ… **Progressive difficulty** keeps you motivated  
âœ… **Clear progress tracking** shows your advancement  
âœ… **Adaptive system** responds to your learning needs
