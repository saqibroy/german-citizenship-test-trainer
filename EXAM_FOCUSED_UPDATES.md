# Exam-Focused Updates - December 2nd, 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED (Critical Fixes)

### 1. SRS Intervals Adjusted for Exam
**Problem**: Mastered items wouldn't appear again for 30-90 days - useless for a Dec 2 exam  
**Solution**: Capped all intervals at MAX 7 DAYS

**New Intervals**:
- 🆕 NEW: 0 days
- 📚 LEARNING: 10 minutes  
- 🌱 YOUNG: 1 day
- 🌿 MATURE: 3 days (was 7)
- 🏆 MASTERED: 5-7 days (was 30-90 days)

**Result**: Even "mastered" items will be reviewed every 5-7 days until the exam!

### 2. Performance Page Text Fixed
**Problem**: White text on white background - invisible!  
**Solution**: Added explicit text-white colors and backdrop-blur

**Fixed Elements**:
- Coverage, Mastery, Accuracy cards now have white bold text
- Pass Probability text is white
- All cards have better visual contrast

### 3. Exam Countdown Added
- Big red badge at top showing days until exam
- Shows "🗓️ Prüfung in X Tagen - 2. Dezember 2025"
- Updates recommendations to be exam-focused

### 4. Exam-Focused Recommendations
Changed from generic advice to urgent action items:
- 🚨 Priority warnings if coverage < 80%
- Daily question calculation: "Do X questions/day = All covered"
- Due reviews highlighted as crucial
- Weak categories with specific focus areas
- Daily habit reminder with days-until-exam urgency

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS / TODO

### Priority 1: Redesign Home Page (NEXT)
**Issues**: 
- Too cluttered and messy
- No clear call-to-action
- Doesn't show exam urgency
- Poor visual hierarchy

**Plan**:
- Large exam countdown at top
- Test Readiness Score widget
- 3 clear CTAs: Start Training / Take Quiz / Review Due Items
- Daily goal tracker
- Progress ring showing % complete
- Remove clutter, focus on action

### Priority 2: Category-Balanced Question Selection
**Problem**: Training might skip important categories  
**Solution**:
- Modify selectTrainingQuestions() to ensure all 17 categories covered
- Distribute questions proportionally based on category size
- Prioritize weak categories but maintain balance
- Show category coverage in training intro screen

### Priority 3: Update Vocabulary to Use New SRS
**Current**: Vocabulary uses old simple system  
**Needed**:
- Apply same 5-level SRS to vocabulary
- Cap vocab intervals at 7 days too
- Update VocabTrainingPage to use srsAlgorithm.ts
- Show SRS level indicators in vocab cards
- Remove vocab from Performance Dashboard (focus on questions only)

### Priority 4: Expand Grammar Lessons
**Research needed for**:
- More practical tips and tricks
- Common mistakes Germans don't make but learners do
- Test-specific grammar patterns
- Sentence structure shortcuts
- Word order mnemonics
- More examples from actual test questions
